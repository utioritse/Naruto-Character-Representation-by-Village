# Naruto Character Representation by Village  

## Goal  
The Naruto series by **Masashi Kishimoto** features a vast array of characters, primarily from the **Hidden Leaf Village**, where the protagonist hails from. However, the series also introduces characters from other major villages: **Hidden Sand**, **Hidden Mist**, **Hidden Cloud**, and **Hidden Stone**.  

This project aims to determine which village had the most character representation after the Hidden Leaf.  

## Process  
1. Dataset Preparation:  
   - Identified and cleaned a dataset of Naruto characters, filling in gaps where some were missing.  
2. Visualization:  
   - Imported the dataset into **Power BI**.  
   - Color-coded the characters based on their village for clear visual comparisons.  


## Key Insights  
- The Hidden Leaf Village dominates character representation.  
- The Hidden Mist Village comes in second, a data point slightly skewed by The Seven Swordsmen of Kirikagure.  


## Tools  
- Dataset: Curated from available character databases and cleaned for completeness.  
- PowerBi: Used to create clear and colourful visualizations comparing character representation.
